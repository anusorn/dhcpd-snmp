[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
      $ dhcpd-snmp [--test] dhcpd-snmp.conf

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
    [1mdhcpd-snmp[0m is an extension for the Net-SNMP agent and the ISC DHCP server.
    It allows you to monitor and track the address usage of your dynamic IP
    address pools through SNMP.

[1mCONFIGURATION FILE[0m
    The configuration file defines the location of the dhcpd.leases file as
    well as the pools of which you want to access the lease counts.

    The file is in [1mkey: value[0m format and allows only two keys:

    [1mleases[0m: "/var/lib/dhcp3/dhcpd.leases"
            Location of the dhcpd.leases file. This file needs to be
            accessible by the script.

    [1mpool[0m: "index", "description", "ip1-ip2, ip3-ip4..."
            Defines a pool to monitor. "index" is a unique numeric index,
            "description" a textual description of this pool, and "ip1-ip2,
            ip3-ip4, ..." defines the ranges of IP addresses belonging to this
            pool.

    Since this extension is a persistent script, changes to the configuration
    file require a restart of snmpd.

[1mINSTALLATION[0m
    After installing the [1mdhcpd-snmp[0m script and adapting the configuration
    file, test if the configuration is valid:

      $ path/to/dhcpd-snmp --test path/to/dhcpd-snmp.conf

    This will print per-pool stats.

    If this works, it can be installed in Net-SNMP. To install it, the
    following line needs to be inserted in the snmpd.conf file:

      pass_persist .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2 path/to/dhcpd-snmp path/to/dhcpd-snmp.conf

    Net-SNMP will need to be restarted after this change.

    You should now be able to get the statistics using snmpwalk, for example:

      $ snmpwalk host community .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2

    This should give you a list of the statistics of your DHCP server.

    = head2 RUNNING THE SCRIPT INTERACTIVELY

    [1mdhcpd-snmp[0m is a simple script which is run by Net-SNMP and which is
    controlled using stdin/stdout. If you run it interactively, you can
    control it as follows:

      PING

    The script should return "PONG".

      get
      .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2.1

    The script should return three lines: the OID, "integer", and the number
    of configured pools.

      get
      .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2.2.2.1

    OID, "string", and the name of your first address pool.

      get
      .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2.2.4.1

    OID, "integer", and the number of active leases.

    Quit the dialog using CTRL-D.

[1mMIB[0m
    The script returns the following variables:

      .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2.1: number of configured pools
      .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2.2.<pool>: pool description
      .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2.3.<pool>: size of the pool (number of addresses)
      .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2.4.<pool>: active leases
      .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2.5.<pool>: expired leases
      .1.3.6.1.4.1.21695.1.2.6.<pool>: available addresses (size - active leases)

    For a complete MIB file see the "mibs" directory in the source archive.

[1mSECURITY[0m
    It is assumed that users of this script know how to properly secure their
    snmpd. Please read the corresponding man pages on more information about
    this.
